Yet Another (Git) Porcelain
===========================
This project is three things, in increasing order of relevance:

    1) A git porcelain implemented in python
    2) A git porcelain with a friendlier, more orthogonal interface
    3) A extensible git porcelain

The third point is most interesting, because as far as the author is
aware, it is the first such project to attempt to achieve this.
Included in this distribution are plugins to create backups during
revert, make "temporary" commits, and ease interoperability with
subversion repositories.

Using git to operate on subversion-hosted repositories is a frequent use
case, and will continue to be until the world embraces git as the
awesome tool it is (keep in mind that even CVS is still in common
usage).  The git-svn tool distributed with git greatly facilitates this.
However, using git-svn requires markedly different workflows, commands,
and mental processes than does working with git-native repositories.

By leveraging the extensible nature of yap, its svn mode strives to make
a remote svn repository act and feel as much like a git repository as
possible to lessen the impedance mismatch to the user.

Yap is still very much a work-in-progress.  Patches are welcome.
Suggestions are welcome.  Bug reports are expected.  Hopefully this
yap can fill a gap in your git toolbox.
