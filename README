* Yet Another (Git) Porcelain
    * Use only git plumbing
    * Make UI cleanups like eg
        * --staged instead of --cached
        * "switch" instead of checkout
        * show "status" after any modifying command
        * "add" distinct from "stage"
            * don't put file in index automatically
    * New features
        * Track "local" commits to limit history re-writing
        * Better SVN workflows
            * Bring metadata / config over in clone?
            * Keep metadata out of commit message?
        * Plugin system?
            * Register new commands
            * Modify existing commands?  Pre/Post-hooks?
            * 3 options
                * plugin provides override for certain commands
                    * only one plugin can override
                * plugins can register pre/post-hooks for commands
        * Plugin ideas
            * svn
                * override push/fetch
            * mls
                * override clone
                * add post-fetch for daily/bdaily revs
            * track published history
                * pre-hook for history (point?)
            * backup (foo~) on revert
                * pre-revert hook
            * commit -t
                * override commit

TODO:
    * Commands

        * merge
        * resolved
