* Yet Another (Git) Porcelain
    * Use only git plumbing
    * New features
        * Track "local" commits to limit history re-writing
        * Better SVN workflows
            * Bring metadata / config over in clone?
            * Keep metadata out of commit message?
        * Plugin ideas
            * svn
                * override push/fetch
            * mls
                * override clone
                * add post-fetch for daily/bdaily revs
            * track published history
                * pre-hook for history (point?)

TODO:
    * Commands
        * merge
    * Better commit template message
    * Fixups for running outside root?
	* relative paths is status
