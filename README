* Yet Another (Git) Porcelain
    * Use only git plumbing
    * Make UI cleanups like eg
        * --staged instead of --cached
        * "switch" instead of checkout
        * show "status" after any modifying command
        * "add" distinct from "stage"
            * don't put file in index automatically
    * New features
        * Track "local" commits to limit history re-writing
        * Better SVN workflows
            * Bring metadata / config over in clone?
            * Keep metadata out of commit message?

TODO:
    * Commands
	* show
        * push
        * fetch
        * merge
        * resolved
        * remote (list/create)
            * -d to remove
	* history
	    * amend (amend an arbitrary commit with stash/rebase)
	    * drop (remove a commit from history)
	* cherry-pick
	    * -r to apply the opposite
    * Better commit template message
	* prepopulate with old commit message after uncommit?
    * Fixups for running outside root?
	* staged has full path, unstaged has relative path
