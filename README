* Yet Another (Git) Porcelain
    * Use only git plumbing
    * Make UI cleanups like eg
        * --staged instead of --cached
        * "switch" instead of checkout
        * show "status" after any modifying command
        * "add" distinct from "stage"
            * don't put file in index automatically
    * New features
        * Track "local" commits to limit history re-writing
        * Better SVN workflows
            * Bring metadata / config over in clone?
            * Keep metadata out of commit message?
    * Commands
        * clone
        * init
        * add (new files only)
        * rm
        * stage (existing files only)
        * status
        * diff
        * unstage
        * unedit
        * commit
        * log
        * uncommit
        * branch (list/create branch)
            * -d to remove
            * -f to remove leaf branch
        * switch
        * push
        * fetch
        * merge
        * resolved
        * remote (list/create)
            * -d to remove
